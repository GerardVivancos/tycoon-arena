## Ideas:

* Surround (corraling enemies) a movement by which a group of units surrounds an enemy unit or group of units, which have to be fewer in number in a way that the attacking units can actually surround them. This mimics street gang intimidation tactics. This movement can be used to force an enemy to move in a certain direction, or to prevent them from moving in a certain direction. It also permits attacks that require "intimidation" to be used.

* Intimidation attacks: some attacks can only be used if the target is intimidated, which can be achieved by surrounding them with a greater number of units. This can be used to represent psychological warfare, or to represent the use of fear as a weapon.
