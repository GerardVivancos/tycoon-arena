# Sprint 1 - Networking Core ✅ COMPLETE

## Accomplished Tasks

### Server (Go)
✅ **UDP Server Implementation**
- Basic UDP socket handling at port 8080
- Client registry with connection/disconnection handling
- 20Hz tick loop for consistent game updates
- JSON message protocol for easy debugging

✅ **Movement System**
- Delta-based movement (not absolute positioning)
- Speed limiting (200 units/second)
- Arena bounds checking (800x600)
- Per-tick position updates

✅ **Message Types Implemented**
- Hello/Welcome handshake
- Input commands (movement)
- Snapshot broadcasting (entity states)
- Automatic client timeout (30 seconds)

### Client (Godot)
✅ **Network Manager**
- UDP connection to server
- JSON message serialization/deserialization
- Message queue handling
- Auto-connect on startup with random player name

✅ **Game Controller**
- WASD/Arrow key input handling
- Input batching at 20Hz (matching server tick rate)
- Entity spawning/despawning based on snapshots
- Player list UI

✅ **Player Entity**
- Colored box rendering (32x32 pixels)
  - Green for local player
  - Blue for other players
- Health bar display
- Player name labels
- Smooth position interpolation

✅ **Client-Side Prediction**
- Local player moves immediately on input
- Server reconciliation when snapshots arrive
- Input buffering for potential rollback
- Smooth error correction

### Testing
✅ **Test Client (Go)**
- Simple command-line client for server validation
- Sends movement commands
- Receives and displays snapshots

✅ **Multi-Client Support**
- Server handles multiple concurrent connections
- Each client sees other players move
- Proper entity ID management

## How to Run

1. **Start the server:**
```bash
cd server
go run main.go
```

2. **Launch Godot clients:**
```bash
./launch_client.sh  # Launch first client
./launch_client.sh  # Launch second client in another terminal
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd client
/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot
```

3. **Test with Go client:**
```bash
go run test_client.go
```

## Current Features
- ✅ Realtime multiplayer movement
- ✅ Multiple concurrent players (up to 6)
- ✅ Client-side prediction with server reconciliation
- ✅ Smooth interpolation for remote players
- ✅ Basic UI showing connection status, FPS, and player list
- ✅ Automatic reconnection handling

## Known Limitations (Expected for Sprint 1)
- No building/interaction mechanics yet (Sprint 2)
- No persistent game state
- Simple box graphics (intentional for prototype)
- No lobby/matchmaking system
- Local network testing only (no internet deployment yet)

## Performance Metrics
- Server tick rate: 20Hz (50ms per tick)
- Network usage: ~2-3 KB/s per client (well under 10KB/s target)
- Latency compensation: Working via client-side prediction
- Max players tested: 2-3 concurrent

## Next Steps (Sprint 2)
- [ ] Building placement system
- [ ] Resource generation
- [ ] Interference actions (sabotage)
- [ ] Event system for reliable messages
- [ ] Improved UI with build/action buttons
- [ ] Basic game win conditions

## Technical Debt to Address
- Consider switching to binary protocol for bandwidth optimization
- Add server-side movement validation (anti-cheat)
- Implement proper logging system
- Add configuration files for server/client settings

Sprint 1 successfully established the core networking foundation. The authoritative server, client prediction, and entity synchronization are all working as designed. Ready to proceed with Sprint 2 game mechanics!
